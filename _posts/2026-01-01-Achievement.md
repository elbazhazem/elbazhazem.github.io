# Academic and Professional Achievements – 2025  

As 2025 comes to a close, it is important to document a year marked by exceptional academic and professional commitment, unfolding within highly non-traditional and constrained circumstances. The year was shaped by severe humanitarian, institutional, and technical challenges resulting from the ongoing war and its direct impact on the academic and research environment in Gaza.

Despite these conditions, 2025 became a year of academic continuity, strategic adaptation, and a deliberate shift toward more applied and impactful research directions.

## 1. Academic and Teaching Activities

Throughout 2025, I continued my work as a faculty member and researcher in the areas of:

- Cybersecurity  
- Network and Cloud Security  
- Log Analysis and Anomaly Detection  
- AI-Driven Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation  

This included university teaching, academic supervision of graduation projects and research, and the development of instructional content that bridges theoretical foundations with practical, industry-relevant applications.

## 2. Research and Development

On the research front, my work during 2025 focused on:

- Developing anomaly detection models using machine learning and deep learning techniques  
- Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into security log analysis workflows  
- Designing and prototyping AI-driven SOC automation frameworks  
- Expanding and refining research papers targeting submission to peer-reviewed journals and conferences  

A significant portion of this work was conducted under severe operational constraints, including power outages, limited connectivity, and restricted access to computational resources, necessitating highly adaptive research planning and execution strategies.

## 3. Transition Toward Applied and Open Research

A key milestone in 2025 was a methodological shift toward applied, open, and reproducible research, with emphasis on:

- Documenting research workflows and outputs through open-source GitHub repositories  
- Building reusable and extensible research artifacts  
- Aligning academic research with real-world SOC operational needs  
- Promoting applied research culture among students and early-career researchers  

This transition was driven by a strategic objective to maximize scientific, educational, and societal impact in resource-constrained environments.

## 4. Academic Leadership and Capacity Building

In parallel with research and teaching responsibilities, I continued to contribute to:

- Mentorship and academic guidance for students and graduates  
- Participation in training and capacity-building initiatives  
- Engagement in discussions related to research development and academic resilience  
- Strategic planning for future initiatives aimed at creating more sustainable learning and research environments
