# üß† Building a SOC Home Lab from Zero ‚Äî Catching Real Attackers on Azure

> *‚ÄúEvery attack is a lesson ‚Äî the key is building systems that learn faster than attackers do.‚Äù*

## üöÄ Introduction

In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through one of my most exciting hands-on projects ‚Äî building a **Security Operations Center (SOC) from scratch** using **Microsoft Azure‚Äôs free tier** and **Microsoft Sentinel**.  
This project is not just theoretical; it captures **real-world cyberattacks** and transforms them into **actionable intelligence** through dashboards and live maps.

Whether you‚Äôre a **cybersecurity student**, **SOC analyst**, or **researcher**, this lab is an ideal starting point to explore how professional SOC environments detect, collect, and analyze threats in real time.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Why I Built This Project

After years of teaching and researching cybersecurity, I wanted to design a lab that:
- **Bridges theory and reality** ‚Äî by exposing a honeypot to actual attackers.
- **Empowers learners** ‚Äî to build and observe a functioning SOC environment.
- **Showcases portfolio-ready skills** ‚Äî for anyone pursuing a cybersecurity career.

By using Azure‚Äôs free resources, anyone can replicate this setup safely and affordably.

---

## üîç Project Overview

Here‚Äôs what the home SOC includes:

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Azure Subscription (Free Tier)** | Deploys all resources at zero cost. |
| **Honeypot VM** | A Windows 10 machine deliberately exposed to attackers. |
| **Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)** | Centralized log storage and analysis engine. |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | SIEM platform for correlation, alerting, and visualization. |
| **Live Attack Map** | Displays attack origins in real time. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Highlights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setting up Azure
Create a free Azure subscription and configure:
- Resource Group  
- Virtual Network (VNet)  
- Virtual Machine (Windows 10 Honeypot)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying the Honeypot
Expose the VM intentionally:
- Delete RDP security rules.
- Allow all inbound traffic.
- Disable Windows Firewall to attract attacks.

‚ö†Ô∏è *This should be done only in an isolated lab environment.*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Observing Attacks
Within minutes, automated bots start brute-forcing your VM.

Monitor **Event ID 4625 (Failed Login)** using Windows Event Viewer:
- Username attempted
- IP address
- Failure reason

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Integrating with Sentinel
Use the **Azure Monitor Agent** to forward logs to **Log Analytics Workspace**.  
Then, connect Sentinel to the workspace for correlation and visualization.

Sample KQL Query:
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| project TimeGenerated, Account, IpAddress = tostring(parse_json(AdditionalFields)["IpAddress"])
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
````

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Enriching Data with GeoIP

Import `geoip-summarized.csv` as a **Sentinel Watchlist** to map attacks to their geographic origins.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizing Attacks

Create a custom Sentinel **Workbook** using `map.json` to generate a **live global attack map**.
You‚Äôll see where attackers are coming from ‚Äî in real time.

## üìä Results and Insights

Within hours of exposure, the honeypot began receiving:

* Hundreds of **failed login attempts**.
* Attack sources from **over 50 countries**.
* Common usernames like `admin`, `test`, and `employee`.

These logs reflect the **global nature of cyber threats** and demonstrate how SOCs continuously analyze suspicious activities to safeguard systems.

---

## üß† Lessons Learned

* **Attack simulation** is a powerful learning tool.
* Understanding **Event ID 4625** is essential for brute-force detection.
* **KQL** is a must-know language for any SOC analyst.
* Visual dashboards turn complex data into clear stories for decision-makers.

---

## üß© Next Steps

Future enhancements:

* Integrate **Sysmon** for deeper telemetry.
* Automate alerts with **Logic Apps**.
* Extend to **multi-cloud monitoring** (AWS / GCP).
* Apply **AI models or LLMs** to summarize log anomalies.
