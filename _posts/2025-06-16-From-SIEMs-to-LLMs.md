A personal reflection on why I moved from traditional log analysis tools to LLM-powered log insight engines.

# From SIEMs to LLMs: Why I’m Building AI Tools for Cybersecurity

For years, I worked with SIEM platforms, firewalls, EDRs, and an endless stream of logs.

Like most security professionals, I knew the routine:
- Collect logs from FortiGate, Palo Alto, and EDRs like CrowdStrike
- Push everything to a SIEM (Splunk, Qradar, Elastic)
- Spend hours writing correlation rules
- Sift through hundreds of alerts, only to find most were noise

At some point, I asked myself:
**What if the system could “understand” what the logs are saying, not just parse them?**

## The Limits of Traditional SIEMs

Traditional SIEMs are excellent at:
- Collecting and indexing data
- Applying static rules
- Alerting on predefined patterns

But they **lack context.**  
They don’t *understand* language.  
They can’t **summarize**, **explain**, or **infer** like a human analyst.

That’s where **Large Language Models (LLMs)** come in.

---

## Why LLMs?

LLMs, like GPT-4, bring something new to the table:

✅ They can **summarize complex log entries**  
✅ Extract **anomalies or outliers**  
✅ Translate logs into **natural language**  
✅ Work across diverse sources without custom parsers

It’s not magic — it’s structured prompting, validation, and iteration.

## My First Attempt: Log Insight AI

That’s why I built my first prototype:  
**[Log Insight AI](https://github.com/elbazhazem/log-insight-ai)**

It:
- Reads raw `.log` files
- Uses LLMs to summarize events
- Highlights unusual patterns
- Provides insights in seconds — not hours

It’s still early, but the potential is clear:  
> “I’m not replacing the SOC analyst — I’m giving them a second brain.”

---

## What’s Next?

- Automating anomaly detection with AI
- Combining clustering + LLMs
- Building a hybrid SOC assistant
- Publishing research on real-world results

---

If you’ve ever been overwhelmed by thousands of logs and dozens of dashboards —  
**LLMs might be the tool you’ve been waiting for.**
