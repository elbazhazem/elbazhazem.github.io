### **Key Skills I Gained from this Training**

* Business Model Design & Structuring
* Value Proposition Development
* Customer Segmentation & Market Fit Thinking
* Go-to-Market Strategy Logic
* Revenue Streams & Cost Structure Mapping
* Lean Startup mindset & hypothesis testing
* Translating technical solutions into investor-friendly business language

These skills are extremely relevant to my current direction in **AI-Driven SOC Automation** — helping me bridge between cybersecurity research and business execution.

This course was a strong addition to my learning pipeline, especially as I continue shaping my upcoming technology venture and refining the business logic behind productizing AI-SOC solutions.

**Question to my network:**
What course or recent learning experience gave you a major “perspective shift” in connecting technical work to business value?
