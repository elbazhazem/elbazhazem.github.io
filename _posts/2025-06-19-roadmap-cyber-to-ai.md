# My Roadmap: From Cybersecurity to Applied AI

I’ve spent most of my career in cybersecurity.  
In 2024, I decided to pivot — not away from cyber, but **toward AI-powered security**.

Here’s my roadmap for the transition.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Define a Use Case

I didn’t start with models — I started with **a problem**:
> “How can I make logs easier to understand and analyze?”

That became my first AI-for-cyber project.

---

## 📚 Step 2: Learn the Basics of AI/ML

I focused on:
- Python for data and APIs  
- Numpy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn for traditional models  
- HuggingFace + OpenAI for LLMs  
- LangChain for chaining prompts

---

## 🔬 Step 3: Build Something Small, Fast

→ [Log Analyzer LLM](https://github.com/elbazhazem/log-analyzer-LLM)  
This was my MVP to apply what I learned.

---

## 📈 Step 4: Go Deeper

I’m now:
- Learning clustering + classification  
- Experimenting with fine-tuning  
- Studying academic papers  
- Rebuilding my GitHub profile with applied projects

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Share, Reflect, and Publish

This blog is part of that effort.

I’m also:
- Writing a research paper  
- Applying for academic/industry roles  
- Building a public portfolio of AI + cybersecurity tools

---

## Lessons So Far

- AI is not a destination — it’s a toolkit  
- Focus on **usefulness**, not hype  
- You don’t need a PhD to start
