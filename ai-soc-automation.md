# 🧠 AI-Driven SOC Automation  
Welcome to my specialization page on **AI-Driven Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation**, where I blend my background in cybersecurity with cutting-edge AI tooling. This page documents my research journey, open-source projects, publications, and blog reflections.

---

## 🔍 Why AI for SOC?

Modern SOCs face alert overload, analyst fatigue, and increasing attack complexity. My focus is on using LLMs to:

- Summarize and enrich alerts
- Automate triage and prioritization
- Reduce Mean-Time-To-Respond (MTTR)
- Enable intelligent decision support

---

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🔸 [LLM-SOC-Agent](https://github.com/ai-soc-automation/LLM-SOC-Agent)  
An intelligent SOC pipeline using DistilRoBERTa + LoRA for log enrichment, clustering, and alert contextualization.

### 🔸 [Log Analyzer LLM](https://github.com/elbazhazem/log-analyzer-LLM)
Exploration of log summarization using pretrained LLMs and prompting.

### 🔸 [Log Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/elbazhazem/log-anomaly-detection)  
Research experiments on 2024 datasets including IoTID20-Extended and LR-HR-DDoS2024.

### 🔸 [AI-SOC Datasets](https://github.com/ai-soc-automation/ai-soc-datasets)  
Preprocessed datasets for reproducible SOC experiments (CIC-IDS 2018, SOC-Sim).
