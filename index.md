I'm Hazem Elbaz â€” a cybersecurity researcher and educator from Gaza, now rebuilding my career after surviving war and loss.

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve begun transitioning from traditional cybersecurity to integrating AI into security workflows, starting with projects on log analysis using large language models (LLMs).


Here I share my journey and experinces as a CyberSecurity with AI and LLM Researcher, including my research, projects, and insights into the field. Join me in exploring the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, and discover how LLMs are shaping the future of security.

This site documents my transition â€” technically, professionally, and personally â€” through real-world experiments, open-source projects, and reflective learning.
