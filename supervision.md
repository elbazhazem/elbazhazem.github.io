## üéì Graduate Project

### Master's Thesis  
**[Title: Improve Security over the Wireless Sensor Networks: Case Study ‚Äì Smart Irrigation in the Agricultural Sector](https://github.com/elbazhazem/secure-wsn-agriculture)**  
**By:** Hassan Younis  
**Supervised By:** Dr. Zahir Haddad, Dr. Hazem El-baz  
**Institution:** Al-Aqsa University, Gaza, Palestine  
**Term:** Fall 2025  

**Description:**  
This research focused on enhanced and implementing a secure communication model for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in smart irrigation systems. The work began with a thorough analysis of security challenges specific to agricultural WSNs, followed by the design of a system architecture that integrates lightweight encryption and authentication protocols suitable for low-power sensor nodes. The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated through a smart irrigation case study, where sensor data‚Äîsuch as soil moisture and temperature‚Äîis securely transmitted to a cloud-based platform for analysis and decision-making. This secure communication ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, addressing key vulnerabilities in WSN deployments.

## üéì Undergraduate Project

### Bachelor Graduation Project  
**Title: [Advancing Network Intrusion Detection with the LycoS-Unicas-IDS 2018 Dataset:Tackling Imbalanced Big Data with Machine Learning](https://github.com/elbazhazem/NIDs-ML)**  
**By:** Besan Ayman Abu Zubaida  
**Supervised By:** Dr. Hazem El-baz  
**Institution:** Al-Aqsa University ‚Äì Faculty of Computer and Information Technology  
**Program:** Bachelor of Networks and Mobile Technology  
**Term:** Spring 2024  

**Description:**  
his project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify network traffic as either benign or other malicious types, leveraging the **LycoS-Unicas-IDS2018 dataset**, which addresses limitations in earlier IDS datasets. The project integrates advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy and efficient detection rates.
