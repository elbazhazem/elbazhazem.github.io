## üéì Graduate Project

### Master's Thesis  
**Title: Identifying Anomalous Network Traffic Through Clustering and Classification Methods: DoS Attacks as a Case Study**  
**By:** Belal Eiad Shehada  
**Supervised By:** Dr. Hazem El-baz  
**Institution:** Al-Aqsa University, Gaza, Palestine  
**Term:** under progress  

**Description:**  
The key challenge in detecting DoS attacks is distinguishing malicious traffic from legitimate traffic in real-time. Traditional security systems, such as firewalls or rule-based intrusion detection systems, struggle with detecting new or evolving DoS attack patterns. Thus, there is a need for more advanced techniques that can learn from network traffic data and identify unusual patterns indicative of an attack.


**Title: [Improve Security over the Wireless Sensor Networks: Case Study ‚Äì Smart Irrigation in the Agricultural Sector](https://github.com/elbazhazem/secure-wsn-agriculture)**  
**By:** Hassan Younis  
**Supervised By:** Dr. Zahir Haddad, Dr. Hazem El-baz  
**Institution:** Al-Aqsa University, Gaza, Palestine  
**Term:** Fall 2025  

**Description:**  
This research focused on enhanced and implementing a secure communication model for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in smart irrigation systems. The work began with a thorough analysis of security challenges specific to agricultural WSNs, followed by the design of a system architecture that integrates lightweight encryption and authentication protocols suitable for low-power sensor nodes. The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated through a smart irrigation case study, where sensor data‚Äîsuch as soil moisture and temperature‚Äîis securely transmitted to a cloud-based platform for analysis and decision-making. This secure communication ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, addressing key vulnerabilities in WSN deployments.

## üéì Undergraduate Project

### Bachelor Graduation Project  
**Title: [Internship Management System for University Students](https://github.com/IbrahemMohammedSaidAhmed/training_system)**  
**By:** Ibrahim M. Sayed Ahmed  
**Supervised By:** Dr. Hazem El-baz  
**Institution:** Al-Aqsa University ‚Äì Faculty of Computer and Information Technology  
**Program:** Bachelor of Networks and Mobile Technology  
**Term:** April 2025 

**Description:**  
Internship Management System for University Students is a web-based platform developed to digitize and streamline the internship process for universities. Built using Laravel (PHP), MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system enables students to register, submit reports, and receive evaluations online. Academic supervisors and host companies can track progress, provide feedback, and manage assessments in real time. The project improves communication, reduces paperwork, and offers data analytics for better decision-making. It was developed as a bachelor graduation project at Al-Aqsa University under the supervision of Dr. Hazem Abdel-Qader El-Baz.

**Title: [Advancing Network Intrusion Detection with the LycoS-Unicas-IDS 2018 Dataset:Tackling Imbalanced Big Data with Machine Learning](https://github.com/elbazhazem/NIDs-ML)**  
**By:** Besan Ayman Abu Zubaida  
**Supervised By:** Dr. Hazem El-baz  
**Institution:** Al-Aqsa University ‚Äì Faculty of Computer and Information Technology  
**Program:** Bachelor of Networks and Mobile Technology  
**Term:** Spring 2024  

**Description:**  
This project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify network traffic as either benign or other malicious types, leveraging the **LycoS-Unicas-IDS2018 dataset**, which addresses limitations in earlier IDS datasets. The project integrates advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy and efficient detection rates.
